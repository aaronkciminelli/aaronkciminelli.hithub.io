					<h1>Experience</h1>
					<h3 style="color:#3DD872"> US Army, Staff Sergeant /Squad Leader, <em style="font-size: 15px">2010-2018</em></h3>
					<p>During my military service, I was an active member of combat operations and provided support in various capacities. I assisted in the mobilization of vehicles, troops, and equipment and mentored junior team members on tactics and procedures, contributing to the team's overall success. I was responsible for maintaining and operating communications equipment, as well as recording operational information on maps. My experience in navigation and troop training also enabled me to aid in the planning and implementation of combat operations. I continuously developed my skills and knowledge through ongoing training, ensuring the team was well-equipped to carry out their missions. These experiences have equipped me with strong leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities that are transferable to a variety of civilian settings.

					<p>As a Security Officer at Lowe's Direct Fulfillment Center, I ensured the safety and security of the facility and its employees by monitoring the premises, conducting searches, screening employees and trailers, responding to reports of suspicious activity, enforcing site rules, patrolling public areas, preparing incident reports, conducting site searches, and verifying identities of authorized persons. I used de-escalation and crisis management techniques as needed. These experiences have developed my attention to detail, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills.

					<h3 style="color:#3DD872"> SimplerFlex, Customer Service Resoulustions Expert <em style="font-size: 15px">2010-2018</em></h3>
					<p>As a Customer Service Representative, I was responsible for verifying and obtaining required referrals and authorizations prior to services being provided. I obtained patient data to facilitate verification, handled high call volume, and instilled calm in customers while managing escalations and transfers. I offered customers current product and service information, continuously improved job knowledge through training and expert use of available knowledge bases, and built rapport with customers through active listening. I documented information from customers to determine product or service problems, processed customer exchanges and refunds, referred unresolved customer grievances to designated departments, identified causes of product malfunctions, and followed up with customers to share findings and offer solutions.
