				<a href="#item1">Quote Generator (Click Me)</a>
				<div class="button-container">
				<button onclick="window.open('QuoteGen.html')">View Quote Generator</button>
				</div>

				<p>To start, I defined variables for different elements of the webpage such as the container for the quote, the quote text, author text, Twitter button, and a loader. I also created an empty array called 'apiQuotes' which stores quotes fetched from an external API.</p>
				<p>Next, I created a couple of functions to help with displaying and hiding elements. The 'showLoadingSpin()' function shows the loader and hides the quote container while the 'removeLoadingSpin()' function does the opposite.</p>
				<p>The 'newQuote()' function displays a random quote fetched from the 'apiQuotes' array, sets the quote and author texts, and styles the quote text based on its length.</p>
				<p>To fetch the quotes, I used the fetch() method within the 'getQuotes()' function. This function retrieves the quotes from an external API and converts the response to JSON format. Then, it calls the 'newQuote()' function to display a new quote.</p>
				<p>Lastly, I created a function called 'tweetQuote()' that creates a Twitter URL that includes the quote and author texts, and opens it in a new tab when the Twitter button is clicked.</p>
				<p>The 'newQuote()' function is called when the page loads, and the 'getQuotes()' function is called both when the page loads and when the 'newQuote()' function is called. The 'tweetQuote()' function is called when the Twitter button is clicked.</p>

			</div>

			<p>I recently learned how to fetch random images from the Unsplash API and display them in a responsive grid for my portfolio website. I'm excited to share with you the JavaScript code I used to accomplish this.</p>
			<p>The code uses event listeners to check for loaded images and when the user has reached the bottom of the page, allowing for the dynamic loading of more images. Additionally, a loading spinner appears while the images are being loaded to enhance the user experience.</p>
			<p>The Unsplash API offers a wide variety of high-quality images that can enhance the visual appeal of any website. This API only allows 50 retrieves an hour, so if you dont see any images please check back later. </p>

			  <a href="#item3">Joke Generator (link comming soon)</a>
			  <p>This is a JavaScript code that fetches jokes from a joke API and uses the VoiceRSS Text-to-Speech API to convert the jokes to audio. The code includes an event listener on a button that triggers the API request for a new joke, and a function to disable the button while the joke is being played.</p>
			  
			  <p>The <b>`getJokes()`</b> function fetches a random joke from the Joke API, formats it, and passes it to the tellMe() function, which uses the VoiceRSS API to convert the joke to an audio file. The <b>`toggleButton()`</b> function is used to disable the button while the joke is being played, and is triggered by an event listener on the audioElement that listens for when the audio has ended.</p>
			  
			  <p>Overall, this code allows users to listen to random jokes using text-to-speech technology, and includes functionality to prevent the button from being clicked while a joke is being played.</p>

			  <a href="#item4">Picture in Picture (link comming soon)</a>
			  <p>This is a JavaScript code that allows users to share their screen using the built-in screen sharing functionality of modern web browsers. The code initializes two variables, videoElement and button, which are used to reference DOM elements in the HTML document.</p>
			  
			  <p>The <b>`selectMediaStream()`</b> function prompts the user to select a media stream (i.e., a screen or window to share), and passes the selected stream to the videoElement, which is then played. The function also includes an event listener to start playing the video once its metadata has loaded.</p>
			  
			  <p>The button element includes an event listener that triggers the <b>`requestPictureInPicture()`</b> method when clicked. This method allows the video to be played in a Picture-in-Picture (PiP) window, which is a floating window that can be moved around the screen while the video continues to play.</p>
			  <p>Overall, this code provides a simple and effective way for users to share their screen and play it in a Picture-in-Picture window using built-in web browser functionality.</p>
